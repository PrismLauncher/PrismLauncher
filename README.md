MultiMC 5
=========

MultiMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once. It also allows you to easily install and remove mods by simply dragging and dropping.

## Building
Check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Contributing
The repository is currently managed by @peterix and @drayshak - we're the ones likely to review pull requests. If you'd like to contribute to the project please talk to us on IRC (Esper/#MultiMC) first! This helps us organise ideas and keep in contact with you, and we're unlikely to accept anything blindly.

We use [Clang Format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the project. We highly recommend setting it up so the project stays well formatted, but there are issues with it on Windows. If you have trouble setting it up, check [.clang-format](.clang-format) manually. We don't accept pull requests with poor formatting. If you have questions, talk to us on IRC (Esper/#MultiMC) _before_ submitting a pull request.

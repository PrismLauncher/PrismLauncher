# Prism Launcher

Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once.

We are working on a website and other media, for more info we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hX4g537UNE). Logo and branding also coming soon.

## Installation

- All downloads and instructions for Prism Launcher will soon be available.
- Last build status: <https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions>

### Development Builds

There are development builds available [here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.

Portable builds are provided for AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

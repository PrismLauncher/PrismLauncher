/*!
 * \brief Class that each instance type's version list derives from.
 * Version lists are the lists that keep track of the available game versions
 * for that instance. This list will not be loaded on startup. It will be loaded
 * when the list's load function is called. Before using the version list, you
 * should check to see if it has been loaded yet and if not, load the list.
 *
 * Note that this class also inherits from QAbstractListModel. Methods from that
 * class determine how this version list shows up in a list view. Said methods
 * all have a default implementation, but they can be overridden by plugins to
 * change the behavior of the list.

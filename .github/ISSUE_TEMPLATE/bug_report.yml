      If you need help with running Minecraft, please visit us on our Discord before making a bug report.

      Before submitting a bug report, please make sure you have read this *entire* form, and that:
      * You have read the [FAQ](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/wiki/FAQ) and it has not answered your question
      * Your bug is not caused by Minecraft or any mods you have installed.
      * Your issue has not been reported before, [make sure to use the search function!](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/issues)

      **Do not forget to give your issue a descriptive title.** "Bug in the instance screen" makes it hard to distinguish issues at a glance.

0.0:
    - Initial release.
0.1:
    - Reworked the version numbering system to support our [new Git workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
    - Added a tray icon for the console window.
    - Fixed instances getting deselected after FTB instances are loaded (or whenever the model is reset).
    - Implemented proxy settings.
    - Fixed sorting of Java installations in the Java list.
    - Jar files are now distributed separately, rather than being extracted from the binary at runtime.
    - Added additional information to the about dialog.
0.1.1:
    - Hotfix - Changed the issue tracker URL to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues).
0.2:
    - Java memory settings have MB added to the number to make the units obvious.
    - Complete rework of the launcher part. No more sensitive information in the process arguments.
    - Cached downloads now do not destroy files on failure.
    - Mojang service status is now on the MultiMC status bar.
    - Java checker is no longer needed/used on instance launch.
    - Support for private FTB packs.
    - Fixed instance ID issues related to copying FTB packs without changing the instance name.
    - Forge versions are better sorted (build numbers above 999 were sorted wrong).

0.3:
    - Improved instance view
    - Overhauled 1.6+ version loading
    - Added a patch system for instance modification
        - There is no longer a single custom.json file that overrides version.json
        - Instead there are now "patch" files in <instance>/patches/, one for each main tweaker (forge, liteloader etc.)
        - These patches are applied after version.json in a customisable order,
        - A list of these files is shown in the left most tab in the Edit Mods dialog, where a list of libraries was shown before.
        - custom.json can still be used for overriding everything.

    - Tooling support
        - JProfiler

    - Some pre/post command stuff (remove the timeout, variable substitution)
